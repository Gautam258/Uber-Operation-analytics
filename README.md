# ðŸš• Uber Operation Analysis Dashboard (Power BI + SQL + Python + Excel)

A full-stack data analytics project analyzing Uber ride requests to uncover patterns in demand, cancellations, and performance gaps. This end-to-end project combines **Excel (Cleaning)**, **Python (EDA)**, **SQL (Insights)**, and **Power BI (Visualization)**.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- **Excel** â€“ Data formatting and cleaning
- **Python** â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **SQL** â€“ Generating KPIs and intermediate aggregated tables
- **Power BI** â€“ Interactive dashboard creation

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Identify operational bottlenecks (cancellations, unavailability)
- Understand ride demand and supply trends
- Track trip duration and performance by hour/day
- Find top and underperforming drivers
- Provide business-ready insights to improve ride fulfillment

## ðŸ“Š Key Visuals

- Hourly Demand & Supply Gap
- Trip Status by Weekday
- Top 10 Drivers by Completed/Cancelled Trips
- Trip Duration Trends by Hour
- KPI Cards for Fulfillment, Cancellation, No-Car Rate

## ðŸ“Œ Insights Uncovered

- **Fulfillment rate is under 50%** â€” points to major inefficiency
- **High no-car availability rate in evening hours**
- **Cancellations spike midweek (Wednesday, Friday)**
- **Top drivers handle bulk of trips** â€” need better distribution

## ðŸš€ Business Outcomes

- Optimize driver shift scheduling based on demand spikes
- Improve fulfillment and reduce user churn
- Use data-driven driver performance tracking for rewards or retraining
